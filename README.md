# Euler Project

This repository contains the solution to 3 problems from [Euler Project](https://projecteuler.net/about). These 3 problems are [Bouncy Numbers](https://projecteuler.net/problem=112), [Double-base Palindromes](https://projecteuler.net/problem=36) and [Largest Palindrome Product](https://projecteuler.net/problem=4), and they vary in difficulties, which are reflected through their respective completion rates on the Euler Project website.

When solving these problems, I attemped to break them down into smaller challenges. Therefore, the solution of each problem consists of a main function and a helper function. All 3 problems are solved in the same Jupyter Notebook. In addition, I have written 3 Medium blog posts that describe the approach I have taken for each problem.
